# OpenGLDemo 

## Overview

Implemented a sample program to display colored triangle (with self-spin effect)
as well as circles (with tessellation shaders). 

## Dependencies

- OpenGL (Required for Both Versions):
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
- Further Needed for the C/C++ Version: 
  - [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
    - Configuration w.r.t. results of `sudo glxinfo | grep "OpenGL`
    - Command `glxinfo` needs `mesa-utils`
  - Remaining dependencies could be installed via apt:
  ```bash
  apt install libopencv-dev libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev mesa-utils libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev
  ```
- Further Needed for the Python Version (from PyPI):
```bash
pip install numpy PyOpenGL PyGLM glfw
```

## Compile & Run

- C/C++ Version (Run inside `cpp/`): 
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make 
cd ..
./build/OpenGLDemo
```
- Python Version. Run inside `py/`, and replace "py3" with your own conda env name:
```bash
conda activate py3
python main.py
```

## Usage

- Press key `A` to turn on/off rotation. 

## Notes

- Suggested order to read and understand this program: 
  - GLFW callbacks;
  - Triangle (ignore the code related to the self-spin effect);
  - Triangle (with self-spin; involves transformation matrices);
  - Circles (involves tessellation shaders, which are not necessary in the first half of this course). 
- In this program, the circle parameters are passed into tessellation shaders via generic vertex attribute arrays. 
  Note how this differs from the "pass-by-shader-uniforms" method for the sphere example; 
- Please do remember to play with the program as guided by the comments in the tessellation evaluation shader;
- If this program does not work on your VMWare virtual environment, 
  please try to [disable the 3D acceleration feature](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/59146).
